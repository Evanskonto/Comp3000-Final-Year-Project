# Comp3000-Final-Year-Project

The integration of blockchain technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) has a
become a topic of increasing interest in recent years. The decentralized and
immutable nature of blockchainâ€™s ledger can provide security, and efficiency for IoT
data management and communication. In this context, a comparative analysis of
popular blockchain technologies, such as Ripple, Litecoin, Hyperledger Fabric,
becomes essential to determine their suitability for IoT applications.

This project presents a comparative analysis of Ripple, Litecoin, Hyperledger
Fabric using JavaScript language in a WSL terminal in Linux Ubuntu 22.04. The analysis focused on
monitoring the transaction latency, throughput, integrity, and security of each
blockchain technology in IoT context. The study will show the strengths and limitations
of each technology, providing graphs and tables with the results of transaction latency
and throughput of each blockchain technology in Internet of the Things (IoT).
